			<p>Hi! I'm Jay, a full-stack developer.</p>
			<p>Growing up I was a bit of a nerd and naturally gravitated towards tech and software development.</p>
			<p>
				I've studied both Mechatronics Engineering and Computer Science at The University of Newcastle. For a handful of
				reasons, I've since put my studies on pause in favour of pursuing a career in software development!
			</p>
			<p>
				Professionally, I've primarily worked on React applications with NodeJS and Go backends. When I find the time, I
				also like to work on personal projects - building with technologies including Golang, React (with Typescript of
				course), TailwindCSS, Astro and Postgres!
