##### **Introduction**

If you don't already know what Discord is, it's an incredibly popular text, voice, and video chat platform. Discord exposes an API that allows us to create applications that integrate with it. They go a step further and allow for the development of Bot users that can directly interact with users of the platform. They can perform a variety of tasks, from server automation, management, and games etc.

##### **So What Did I Build?**

Before ChatGPT was a household name and the great explosion of popularity in AI, around late 2021, I stumbled across OpenAI and their GPT models through my interest in an application called A.I Dungeon.

Thanks to the pandemic I was using Discord heavily,  both to keep in touch with friends and because a few of my university courses were using it to manage projects.

To stop myself from going mad in isolation, I decided to keep myself busy by working on a project that combine these two things. 

The idea was simple, train some AI models on the the text messages from a combination of my friends and see what the models had to say for themselves.
